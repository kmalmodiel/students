About_me
> Hi! I'm Kristine, 20 years old from Guimbal. I like reading wattpad. I'm not an outdoor person and I enjoy long romantic walks going to bed. :sleepy: :sleeping: 

I'm inlove with this quote:
> "When you get what you want, thats God's direction, when you don't get what you want, that's God's protection." :sparkling_heart:
